# Simply Python Projects
![Python logo](https://www.python.org/static/community_logos/python-logo.png)

A repo where I store any of my simpler coding projects, all made in Python and its various modules.

Currently the repo is structured as follows:
* Math - A folder where I store various math related code.
* Simple Apps - Here I will store various simpler app ideas such as command-line games or my version of various Unix utilities such as `cat`.

Updates will be made sporadically.
